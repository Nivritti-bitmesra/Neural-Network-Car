# Neural-Network-Car

An Autonomous car based on a Neural Network. It learns from its past experience and takes a decision depending upon the present situation. Image processing was used to extract the features of the road. The Binary image thus obtained was reduced to a certain small size using several optimization algorithms and fed into a Neural network. The Network had 4 nodes in the output layer namely Left, Right, forward and backward. This directed the Bot to traverse the path easily.
